May  1, 2009     Found one day short at every month, fixed with
                 re-compiling libgvar on g++ 4.3 

Sep  6, 2005     The index function is revised so that it looks 
		 better now. 

Jul 20, 2005     Epoch Date (8 bytes) is in BCD format in its block. 
                 But in the REC array, REC[11] and REC[12] store only
                 Epoch Date that are already converted into standard
                 IEEE format.
